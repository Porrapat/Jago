Jago Version 4.25
Go Viewer and Client
Freeware by R. Grothmann

This is a SGF (smart go format) viewer, and an
IGS/NNGS (internet go server / no name go server)
client for the game of go. For details before
installation see the Jago homepage.

The program is written in Java and needs a Java
runtime environment. This maybe the Internet
Explorer or Sun's Java runtime. The installer
will install icons for both, and an icon for
the HTML documentation.
