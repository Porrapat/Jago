About Filters

You can edit the filters, which Jago uses to block information or 
messages. By default, information or messages from other users pop up 
a dialog. You can switch this off for all messages with the menu entry 
in the connection frame. But sometimes you will want to block only 
specific messages.

You may create a filter for this. A filter has a name. You can choose,
if the filter should block the message off completely or only prevent a
dialog window to pop up.

A filter is determined by a starting string, a string the message must
contain and an end string. Each of these may be empty.

A positive filter is used to let messages through, even though they 
are blocked off by menu choices. This way you can watch for a specific 
person to enter or leave the server. E.g, if "reduced output" is on, 
messages starting with { are normally blocked off. If a positive 
filter fits on these messages, they will still show up in the 
connection window, and you will get a message sound.

However, there is a specific menu entry to wait for a player.
