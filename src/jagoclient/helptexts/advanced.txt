You can set here some options, which may improve the behaviour of Jago
on your system.

"Pack dialogs" will pack some messages dialogs instead of trying to
remember their position.

"Set own icon" will try to set the icon of the main windows.

"Use AWT TextArea/List" will let you use the normal text areas and
games/player lists, instead of the replacements of Jago. If you are not
satisfied with the server output in the Connection Terminal, try using
the AWT TextArea. It may be faster or slower, depending on your system.
Moreover, you will only be able to store a maximum of 32 KB. The List
option applies in games and player listings and is similar.

"Confirmations" will toggle the extra confirmation when closing a board
or a connection, and when leaving Jago.

"Linux" takes care of special features of the Linux JVM. First of all,
windows will close faster. Secondly, the navigation buttons are used
as normal (which slows them down in Windows, but not in Linux).
