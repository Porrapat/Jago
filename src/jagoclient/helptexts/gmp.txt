Play against a program

If you have a go playing program that supports the go modem protocol,
you can play against it with Jago. This protocol does not need a
modem, as the name suggests, but can connect to any program on your
machine. Jago will start the program and attempt to get moves from
it.

I could test this against GnuGo on Linux and Windows. If you wish, you
can download both versions from the homepage of Gnu Go development at

http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/

I have binaries on our Web server. See the documentation for more
information.

In the settings dialog you have to enter the path to the gnugo
program, and any needed parameters. If this path contains blanks,
enclose the path in quotes ".
