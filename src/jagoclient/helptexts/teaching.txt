Teaching Games

Some servers have an option to teach a game. I.e., one player is
playing both sides. The necessary information should be available with
the command

    help teach

Usually, you open a teaching game with

    teach 19

where 19 is the board size. You then play against yourself. You can
use the kibitz command to comment the game in one of the following two
versions

    kibitz This is a good move!
    ' Too slow!

As usual, these kibitzes will be saved in the game tree as comments.
