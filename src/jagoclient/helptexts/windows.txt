Using Windows

Many details depend on your operation system.

JAGO keeps the sizes and positions of the windows in a file named 
GO.CFG. It tries to write the file into the active directory. So you 
need write access to this directory. In multi-user environments, you 
should set up a local JAGO directory for each user with an 
installation script. Then a script can start JAGO from this directory. 
You pass the JAGO directory as an argument with parameter -home.

Most systems allow cut and paste from text fields. In Windows, use 
CNTRL-C to copy text from anywhere to the clipboard and CONTRL-V to 
paste it into a JAGO input field. Or use the right mouse button to get 
a menu for copying. JAGO is using a replacement for the text areas, 
unless you have chosen the normal text areas in the advanced options 
menu. This allows colored output and has no size limit. the 
replacement can copy to the clipboard.

Dialog windows can be closed with the Escape key, if they have the
keyboard focus.

The text input fields, which send commands to the server, have a
history. You can recall old commands with the Cursor Up key.
