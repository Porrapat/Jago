Partner Connection

With this window, you are connected to a Go partner somewhere in the
world. To send chat to him, enter the text in the text field below the
output window.

To start a game, press the Game button and enter the parameters, then 
press the Request button. If your partner accepts the game, a board 
will show up and you can do moves.

Playing the game is similar to playing over the IGS/NNGS. But timings 
are more accurate, since the time is only running while you are 
thinking. Also, there is no sever to count the result for you. So you 
have to end the game with the corresponding menu item, remove all 
prisoners and use the menu entry to count the result.

Note, that your partner has to agree ending of the game.

You can request an undo of your partner. This will undo your partner's 
move and your own and will add 30 seconds of extra time to your 
partner. The partner can decline the undo.
