Making Moves

To make a move, click on the board. Note, that you can only add a move
at the end of the game tree. To create a variation to a move, shift-
click on the board. This will create a variation, with the current move
replaced by a different move of the same color. You may also use the
right mous button for this, but only if you click on an empty point,
which does not have a variation marker.

Look in the help about variations for more details about the game tree.

To go to a variation, control-click on the green variation marker. Or us
the right mouse button for this.

Fixing a Game Tree

To fix a false move, it is best to undo all moves up to the wrong one.
Or go back to the wrong move and press undo. However, you can also
shift-control-click with the mouse. In this case the current move will
be placed to the new point (which must be empty). Note, that the game
may become confused, if you do this in an incorrect way. Make sure, that
the field in question is empty throughout the subsequent game tree.

You can also insert an empty node into the game tree. This is done
with the menu item "insert node". This is useful to enter a comment
without confusion with the previous board marks.

You may also set or remove black or white stones. Doing this may confuse 
the game tree, however. In any case, you need to press shift-control
while clicking. Furthermore, removal of stones in a position, which
has already a move, is only allowed, if you switch off "pure SGF".
Otherwise, a new variant will be created.
