Mailing Games

You can send a game by email.

If you choose the Mail menu entry, you will get a dialog, where you have
to enter your email address, the destination address and the subject
line for the mail. You also have to enter the SMTP (simple mail transfer
protocol) host. This is the host, which handles your mail. If you are
unsure about this, ask your system administrator. You may find the
correct address also in the mail optinons of your internet browser.

You may edit the message. You should enter comments before the game, and
you should not start a line with a "(" to make sure your SGF viewer
finds the start of the game.
