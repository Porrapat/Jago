Set Encoding

This page sets the encoding for reading and writing local files. If 
you are unsure about your local codepage, delete the string and press 
OK. Jago will then use the default local codepage.

This option is for reading foreign SGF files. E.g., Cp850 will read 
files written under DOS correctly and 8859_1 is the default german 
codepage. Of course, you cannot expect to be able to display Japanese 
comments on a western Windows system, unless you have installed the 
proper fonts. Another useful codepage is UTF8, which writes UTF-8
encoded Unicode. You can also use Unicode itself, but then your
your SGF files will be readable almost nowhere.

You can set the codepage for server connections individually in the 
settings for server connections.
