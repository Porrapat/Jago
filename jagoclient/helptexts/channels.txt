Channels

This dialog opens, if you have joined a channel and a message was sent
into the channel. The program supposes that you can open several
channels. Each channel will give you a different window.

To send a message, enter the message into the text field. Do not enter
the semicolon.

This form is common to IGS and NNGS. However, if you have joined several
channels, you must enter the channel number.

IGS:
; \## message
NNGS:
; ## message

It is a pitty, that these commands are different.

You can send any other command in the text field.

By the way, the text field has a history, which can be accessed with
cursor up or down.
