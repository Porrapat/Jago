Server Help

I cannot give a complete introduction into the IGS protocol here. For a
start type "help" when connected. Please look into the HTML help for
more details.

You can use the Games button to display all current games. From there
you can select a game and observe it. This will give you a board view of
the game, which is updated on every move. A Peek or a Status display the
current state of the game only. Status is faster, but does not load the
game history.

Next you may wish to talk to someone. Use the talk command in the
following way:

talk name Hi, how are you? Want a game?

After the first talk you can abbreviate this to

. Hi, how are you? Want a game?

If someone talks to you, this will be displayed in a separate window.
You can use this window to answer directly.

If you want to match someone, use the match command

match name b 19 10 5

Here, b is your color, 19 is the board size. The game will be in 10
minutes with 5 minutes extra time for 25 moves. You can also select
the player from the player list, which you get by pressing the Who
button. Then you can press the Match button and fill out the form.

If someone matches you, the server will send you the proposed answers
for accepting or declining the match offer. This will open a dialog,
where you can accept or decline the game. The format of the game
request is the same as in the match request.

See the board help for more information about playing a game.
