About Firewalls

If you are behind a company firewall, you will probably not be able to
connect to the internet Go servers directly. If you can telnet to a
machine outside the firewall, you can overcome this difficulty.

To do this add a new server connection in the main go window. Enter 
the address of the machine. Use port 23. Do not enter a name and 
password, but leave these fields blank.

Then connect to the machine. You will find yourself in a simple telnet
session. Login as usual and issue a telnet command to the internet
servers, such as

telnet igs.nuri.net 6969

This will connect to the IGS from the remote machine. Now you will be
prompted for your IGS name and password. You can now use the connection
normally. Disconnecting from IGS will bring back your machines telnet
connection. At this point, you can close the connection window.

Local encodings are not possible via Telnet connections, since the 
telnet protocol sends format commands, which destroy the encoding.
