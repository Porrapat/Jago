Observing vs. Playing

You should be aware that due to the unlucky server protocol, there may
be problems with determining the right type of board.

First of all, if you choose to observe a game, Jago will open an
observer board. It will then run the status command, mainly to get the
board size. After this, it will start observing the game. Then the
server sends a move to this game number, which is rejected, because Jago
wants all previous moves first. So the moves command is sent and the
position builds up.

If you close an observer board, the unobserve command is sent.

Secondly, if you start playing a game, the game number is unknown and
Jago fetches the first unknown game and opens a playing board. After the
status command has been processed (see above), Jago will load the board
position, for it may happen that the game has been loaded after
adjournment. Closing a playing board will send nothing.

Several problems arise out of this procedure.

(a) You close a playing board accidently. In this case, adjourn and
reload the game.

(b) You get a playing board, but want an observer board. This may
happen, if the server starts or keeps sending moves to you (net lag or
other reason). This may not worry you, but you can switch playing off,
so moves will no longer be sent.

(c) You may even play into an observer board (do not know an
application), by switching playing on.
