# How to complied it

- Using Eclipse

Import it to Eclipse project and Run Go.java in default package.
If you need to create .jar file simple go to Eclipse Menu -> File -> Export -> Java -> Runnable Jar File.

- Command Line (Simply run)

```
javac Go.java

It will show warning but you can ignore it!

I have only test it complied with Java SDK 1.8 and only make it Eclipse project to future easy development
